ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dfneto.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning and Python and I'm also developing a software to help people to learn new languages by improving the listening. My ideia is from an audio (like audiobook or a tv series) extract all words with their respective pronunciation and then order the words by most frequent. So, by the end, you will have a list with the most frequent words and their pronunciation by the audio speaker (it means, by the audiobook speaker or by the tv series actor etc.). I believe that this will help the learners to improve their compreension and pronunciation.

My challenge now is to improve the audio of words extracted.
